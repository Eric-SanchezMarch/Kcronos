Program Shutdown C, It is a timer that allows you to close, restart, hibernate or log out at the end of time.

Currently the program works properly for windows and is visually cured, 
however my idea is to improve and apply improvements to this small program, which to be simple I use almost every day.
I would also like to transcribe it for linux, if anyone likes it I would be happy to receive collaborations with this project.

I hope you like it and find it useful :)
